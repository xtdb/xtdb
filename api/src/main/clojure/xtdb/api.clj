(defn plan-q
  "General query execution function for controlling the realized result set.

  Returns a reducible that, when reduced (with an initial value), runs the query and yields the result.
  `plan-q` returns an IReduceInit object so you must provide an initial value when calling reduce on it.

  The main use case for `plan-q` is to stream large results sets without having the entire result set in memory.
  A common way to do this is to call run! together with a side-effecting function process-row!
  (which could for example write the row to a file):

  (run! process-row! (xt/plan-q node ...))

  The arguments are the same as for `q`."

(defn q
  "query an XTDB node.

  - query: either an XTQL or SQL query.
  - opts:
    - `:snapshot-time`: see 'Transaction Basis'
    - `:current-time`: override wall-clock time to use in functions that require it
    - `:default-tz`: overrides the default time zone for the query
    - `:authn`: authentication options

  For example:

  (q node '(from ...))

  (q node ['(fn [a b] (from :foo [a b])) a-value b-value])
  (q node ['#(from :foo [{:a %1, :b %2}]) a-value b-value])
  (q node ['#(from :foo [{:a %} b]) a-value])

  (q node \"SELECT foo.id, foo.v FROM foo WHERE foo.id = 'my-foo'\")
  (q node [\"SELECT foo.id, foo.v FROM foo WHERE foo.id = ?\" foo-id])

  Please see XTQL/SQL query language docs for more details.

  This function returns the results of its query as a vector of maps

  Transaction Basis:

  In XTDB there are a number of ways to control at what point in time a query is run -
  this is done via a snapshot-time basis optionally supplied as part of the query map.

  In the case a basis is not provided the query is guaranteed to run sometime after
  the latest transaction submitted by this connection/node.

  Alternatively a specific snapshot-time can be supplied,
  in this case the query will be run exactly at that system-time, ensuring the repeatability of queries.

  (q node '(from ...)
     {:snapshot-time #inst \"2020-01-02\"}))

  If your node requires authentication you can supply authentication options.

  (q node '(from ...)
     {:authn {:user \"xtdb\" :password \"xtdb\"}})"
  ([node query] (q node query {}))

  ([node query opts]
   (into [] (plan-q node query opts))))
