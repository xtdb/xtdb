= Releasing XTDB

We could automate more of this than we do, but here's a checklist in the meantime.

You can kick off a couple of these in parallel.

You should already have seen a successful CI run-through of the commit you'd like to release.

Version number is `Major.Minor.Patch`, e.g. `2.10.4`.
We use https://github.com/ptaoussanis/encore/blob/master/BREAK-VERSIONING.md[BreakVer].

== Git tag:

. find/replace `<previous-version>` -> `<next-version>`, commit
. `git tag --annotate --sign <next-version>` (magit `t -a -s t`), add release notes to tag.
. `git push origin main <next-version>`

== Github Action

This one tags and publishes the Docker images: https://github.com/xtdb/xtdb/actions/workflows/tag.yml

== JARs

To build the XTDB release artifacts locally and deploy them to Maven Central, run:

Build and deploy release jars:

. `java -version` -> java-11-openjdk
. `git clean -dXf`
. `export XTDB_VERSION=2.0.0` (`set -x XTDB_VERSION=2.0.0` for the fish people)
. `./gradlew clean jreleaserDeploy`

Release the artifacts to central:

. Head over to https://central.sonatype.com/publishing
. Quick smoke-check of all of the packages are as you'd expect (api, core, 3x clouds; all at the correct version).
. Publish
. Check https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/xtdb to see when the artifacts have been mirrored across Maven Central.

It may be sensible to update `2.x-SNAPSHOT` in response to the release, unless it is already ahead.

. `unset XTDB_VERSION` and deploy the new release as link:#releasing-snapshots[2.x-SNAPSHOT]

[NOTE]
====
We use https://jreleaser.org/[JReleaser] to deploy the JARs to Maven.

. First, the `maven-publish` Gradle plugin builds a staging area for the artifacts under `<module>/build/jreleaser/maven-staging` in each sub-module.
  This is configured in the root `build.gradle.kts` for each sub-module that applies the `maven-publish` plugin.
. Then, one `jreleaser` config in the root `build.gradle.kts` combines them all together and uploads them to Maven Central.
====

== Docs:

The documentation site (https://docs.xtdb.com) is deployed through this repo too.

Push a commit to the `origin/docs-live` branch, then AWS Amplify will release it based on a GitHub hook.

== Github release:

. Create a new milestone and ensure that all issues in the "Awaiting Release" column are updated
. Locate tag on https://github.com/xtdb/xtdb/releases[releases page], click 'Edit tag'
. Copy release notes into release description
. Await artifacts, upload artifacts to release
. Await JARs deploying, and ensure 'docs' section is complete - people get notified at this point.
. 'Publish release'
. 'Archive all cards' for the "Awaiting Release" column

NOTE: we could do a fair bit of this through JReleaser too, but for now I prefer the fine-grained control over the release process.

== Publicise:

* Discord
* Clojurians' Slack - #announcements for a major, additionally #releases for a minor if it's 'interesting', additionally #xtdb for a patch.
* LinkedIn
* BlueSky, if appropriate

[#releasing-snapshots]
== Building locally and releasing JAR snapshots:

.  (none of the above sections are required)
.  `java -version` â†’ java-11-openjdk
.  `git clean -dXf`
.  `./gradlew clean jreleaserDeploy`
.  (nothing to be done in Sonatype!)
.  Confirm snapshot is live at https://central.sonatype.com/service/rest/repository/browse/maven-snapshots/com/xtdb/
