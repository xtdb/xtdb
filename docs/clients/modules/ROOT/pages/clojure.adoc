The `xtdb.api` namespace exposes a union of methods from `IXtdb` and `IXtdbDatasource`,
with few lifecycle members added.

     using it (for example, in a `with-open` block). Be cautious with lazy evaluation that may attempt to make requests
     after the DB is closed.")

     This function returns a Cursor of result tuples - once you've consumed
     as much of the sequence as you need to, you'll need to `.close` the sequence.
     A common way to do this is using `with-open`:

     (with-open [res (xt/open-q db '{:find [...]
                                       :where [...]})]

== Lifecycle members

=== start-node

[source,clojure]
----
(defn start-node ^IXtdb [options])
----

NOTE: requires any dependencies on the classpath that the XTDB modules may need.

Accepts a map, or a JSON/EDN file or classpath resource.

See https://xtdb.com/reference/configuration.html for details.

Returns a node which implements IXtdb and java.io.Closeable.
Latter allows the node to be stopped by calling `(.close node)`.

Throws IndexVersionOutOfSyncException if the index needs rebuilding.

=== new-api-client

[source,clojure]
----
(defn new-api-client ^IXtdb [url])
----

Creates a new remote API client IXtdb.
The remote client requires valid and transaction time to be specified for all calls to `db`.

NOTE: Requires either clj-http or http-kit on the classpath,
See https://xtdb.com/reference/http.html for more information.

Param `url` the URL to an XTDB HTTP end-point.

Returns a remote API client.

=== new-submit-client

[source,clojure]
----
(defn new-submit-client ^IXtdbSubmitClient [options])
----

Starts a submit client for transacting into XTDB without running a full local node with index.

Accepts a map, or a JSON/EDN file or classpath resource.

For valid options, see https://xtdb.com/reference/configuration.html.

Returns a xtdb.api.IXtdbSubmitClient component that implements java.io.Closeable.
Latter allows the node to be stopped by calling `(.close node)`.
