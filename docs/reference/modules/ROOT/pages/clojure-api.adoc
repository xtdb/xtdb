`crux.api` exposes a union of methods from `ICruxAPI` and `ICruxDatasource`,
with few lifecycle members added.

=== db

[source,clojure]
----
  (db

    [node ^Date valid-time ^Date transaction-time]

     documents whose valid time is before the specified time.

     When both valid and transaction time are specified returns a db value as of
     the valid time and the latest transaction time indexed at or before the
     specified transaction time.

     This DB opens up shared resources to make multiple requests faster - it must

     block)")

    [node ^Duration timeout]
    "Blocks until the node has caught up indexing to the latest tx available at
  the time this method is called. Will throw an exception on timeout. The

  used as the second parameter in (db valid-time, transaction-time) for
  consistent reads.

  timeout – max time to wait, can be nil for the default.
  Returns the latest known transaction time.")

----

=== listen
[source,clojure]
----
  (listen ^java.lang.AutoCloseable [node event-opts f]
    "Attaches a listener to Crux's event bus.

  `event-opts` should contain `:crux/event-type`, along with any other options the event-type requires.

  We currently only support one public event-type: `:crux/indexed-tx`.
  Supplying `:with-tx-ops? true` will include the transaction's operations in the event passed to `f`.

  `(.close ...)` the return value to detach the listener.

  This is an experimental API, subject to change.")

  operations, which allow the contents under the :crux.api/tx-ops
  key to be piped into (submit-tx tx-ops) of another

[#icruxdatasource]
== ICruxDatasource
Represents the database as of a specific valid and transaction time.

=== entity

[source,clojure]
----
  (entity [db eid]
    "queries a document map for an entity.
    eid is an object which can be coerced into an entity id.
    returns the entity document map.")

    [db query]
    "q[uery] a Crux db.

     This function will return a set of result tuples if you do not specify `:order-by`, `:limit` or `:offset`;
     otherwise, it will return a vector of result tuples.)

=== open-q

[source,clojure]
----
  (open-q
    [db query]
    "lazily q[uery] a Crux db.
     query param is a datalog query in map, vector or string form.

     This function returns a Cursor of result tuples - once you've consumed
     as much of the sequence as you need to, you'll need to `.close` the sequence.
     A common way to do this is using `with-open`:

     (with-open [res (crux/open-q db '{:find [...]
                                       :where [...]})]
       (doseq [row (iterator-seq res)]
         ...))

     Once the sequence is closed, attempting to iterate it is undefined.

    "Eagerly retrieves entity history for the given entity.

    Options:
    * `sort-order`: `#{:asc :desc}`
    * `:with-docs?`: specifies whether to include documents in the entries
    * `:with-corrections?`: specifies whether to include bitemporal corrections in the sequence, sorted first by valid-time, then transaction-time.
    * `:start` (nested map, inclusive, optional): the `:crux.db/valid-time` and `:crux.tx/tx-time` to start at.
    * `:end` (nested map, exclusive, optional): the `:crux.db/valid-time` and `:crux.tx/tx-time` to stop at.

    No matter what `:start` and `:end` parameters you specify, you won't receive
    results later than the valid-time and transact-time of this DB value.

    Each entry in the result contains the following keys:
     * `:crux.db/valid-time`,
     * `:crux.db/tx-time`,
     * `:crux.tx/tx-id`,
     * `:crux.db/content-hash`

[source,clojure]
----
  (valid-time [db]
    "returns the valid time of the db.

== Lifecycle members

=== start-node

[source,clojure]
----
(defn start-node ^ICruxAPI [options])
----

NOTE: requires any dependencies on the classpath that the Crux modules may need.

Accepts a map, or a JSON/EDN file or classpath resource.

See https://opencrux.com/reference/configuration.html for details.

Returns a node which implements ICruxAPI and java.io.Closeable.
Latter allows the node to be stopped by calling `(.close node)`.

Throws IndexVersionOutOfSyncException if the index needs rebuilding.

=== new-api-client

[source,clojure]
----
(defn new-api-client ^ICruxAPI [url])
----

Creates a new remote API client ICruxAPI.
The remote client requires valid and transaction time to be specified for all calls to `db`.

NOTE: Requires either clj-http or http-kit on the classpath,
See https://opencrux.com/reference/http.html for more information.

Param `url` the URL to a Crux HTTP end-point.

Returns a remote API client.

=== new-ingest-client

[source,clojure]
----
(defn new-ingest-client ^ICruxAsyncIngestAPI [options])
----

Starts an ingest client for transacting into Crux without running a full local node with index.

Accepts a map, or a JSON/EDN file or classpath resource.

For valid options, see https://opencrux.com/reference/configuration.html.

Returns a crux.api.ICruxIngestAPI component that implements java.io.Closeable.
Latter allows the node to be stopped by calling `(.close node)`.
