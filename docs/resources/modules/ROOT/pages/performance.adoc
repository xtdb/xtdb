= Performance

Rigorous benchmarking supports the team's development activities by providing rapid feedback on complex changes and a regular benchmark process allows the team to discover and address performance regressions during day-to-day development, well in advance of any releases.

The https://github.com/xtdb/xtdb/tree/main/bench[`bench`] sub-project contains a number of benchmarking suites that are run nightly on standard AWS infrastructure (`m5.xlarge` instances via https://github.com/xtdb/xtdb/blob/main/bench/cloudformation/xtdb-bench.yaml[CloudFormation]) to support regression testing of new development and validate all performance improvement changes.

These suites cover a wide range of analysis at a variety of scale factors, including: graph query performance, bitemporal query performance, ingestion performance (throughput & latency), and disk usage.

Officially published benchmark results are forthcoming, but in the meantime please feel welcome to explore `bench` independently and get in touch if you need any assistance.

For an example of independent benchmarking by the community, see the https://egeria-project.org/connectors/repository/xtdb/performance/["XTDB Connector" performance analysis] by the Linux Foundation's Egeria project, which compares XTDB against an existing JanusGraph Connector.

== TPC-H

.Decision Support Benchmark
****
[%hardbreaks]
http://www.tpc.org/tpch/
The TPC-H is a decision support benchmark. It consists of a suite of business oriented ad-hoc queries and concurrent data modifications. The queries and the data populating the database have been chosen to have broad industry-wide relevance. This benchmark illustrates decision support systems that examine large volumes of data, execute queries with a high degree of complexity, and give answers to critical business questions.

Waterloo SPARQL Diversity Test Suite
https://dsg.uwaterloo.ca/watdiv/
****

WatDiv has been developed to measure how an RDF data management system performs across a wide spectrum of SPARQL queries with varying structural characteristics and selectivity classes.

Benchmarking is performed nightly against the WatDiv test suite. These tests demonstrate comprehensive RDF subgraph matching. Note that XTDB does not natively implement the RDF specification and only a simplified subset of the RDF tests have been translated for use in XTDB. XTDB generates Datalog, which shares many of the same properties as SPARQL, directly from the SPARQL definitions.

Subgraph matching is a fundamental kind of graph query and is a common mechanism for computing query results in SPARQL: RDF triples in both the queried RDF data and the query pattern are interpreted as nodes and edges of directed graphs, and the resulting query graph is matched to the data graph using variables as wildcards.

The diversity and scale of subgraph matching in the WatDiv tests provides a particularly helpful measure of end-to-end performance across many dimensions.

== DataScript

XTDB's test suite incorporates a large number of https://github.com/tonsky/datascript[DataScript]'s query tests, demonstrating extensive functional coverage of DataScript's Datalog implementation.

Lehigh University Benchmark
http://swat.cse.lehigh.edu/projects/lubm/
****

The Lehigh University Benchmark is developed to facilitate the evaluation of
Semantic Web repositories in a standard and systematic way. The benchmark is
intended to evaluate the performance of those repositories with respect to
extensional queries over a large data set that commits to a single realistic
ontology. It consists of a university domain ontology, customizable and
repeatable synthetic data, a set of test queries, and several performance
metrics.

== Racket Datalog

Several Datalog tests from the Racket Datalog examples have been translated and
re-used within XTDB's query tests.

Specifically, from https://github.com/racket/datalog/tree/master/tests/examples

- tutorial.rkt
- path.rkt
- revpath.rkt
- bidipath.rkt
- sym.rkt

[#datalog]
== Datalog Research

Several Datalog examples from a classic Datalog paper have been translated and
re-used within XTDB's query tests.
