XTDB is an immutable SQL database that reduces the time and cost of building and maintaining safe systems of record. You can read more about our mission [here](/intro/why-xtdb).

In XTDB there's no need for handcrafted "audit tables", or bespoke versioning and filtering logic - just write regular looking SQL and a granular history of all changes will be preserved (and be accessible for whenever you need it!):


<Xtplay magicContext="my-context">
  <Txs systemTime="2024-01-01"
       txs="INSERT INTO product (_id, name, price) VALUES
            (1, 'An Electric Bicycle', 400)" />
  <Txs systemTime="2024-01-05"
       txs="UPDATE product SET price = 405 WHERE _id = 1" />
  <Txs systemTime="2024-01-10"
       txs="UPDATE product SET price = 350 WHERE _id = 1" />
  <Query q={`SELECT *, _valid_from
FROM product
  FOR VALID_TIME ALL -- i.e. "show me all versions"
  FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF DATE '2024-01-31' -- "...as observed at month end"`} />
</Xtplay>


Unlike regular SQL databases, XTDB retains all history by default and helps businesses to easily and accurately report: _**“Here is the complete history of my data, as I understood it previously, and as I understand it currently.”**_

XTDB builds upon the 'bitemporal' capabilities defined within [SQL:2011](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL:2011) but makes those capabilities both ubiquitous and automatic, without imposing any unnecessary complications on the application schema.

<Aside title="Looking for 1.x (stable release)?">
    <p>This is the documentation site for XTDB 2.x, which is currently in 'beta' whilst we collaborate closely with our [Design Partners](https://forms.gle/K2bMsPxkbreKSKqs9) ahead of General Availability.</p>
    <p>To find out more about how 2.x relates to 1.x, see <a href="https://xtdb.com/v2" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
    <p>For documentation on the stable, production-ready 1.x releases of XTDB, see <a href="https://v1-docs.xtdb.com" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

## Learn XTDB in 10 minutes

To discover the novel features of XTDB, take a look at the interactive [SQL Quickstart](/quickstart/sql-overview).

Or alternatively, you may want to get XTDB [running locally via Docker](/intro/installation-via-docker) first, and then read through the [SQL Quickstart](/quickstart/sql-overview).
