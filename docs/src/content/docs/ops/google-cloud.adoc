title: Google Cloud
---

XTDB provides modular support for Google Cloud environments, including a prebuilt Docker image, integrations with **Google Cloud Storage**, and configuration options for deploying onto Google Cloud infrastructure.

NOTE: For more details on getting started with Google Cloud, see the link:guides/starting-with-gcp["Setting up a cluster on Google Cloud"^] guide.

== Required Infrastructure

In order to run a Google Cloud based XTDB cluster, the following infrastructure is required:

* A **Google Cloud Storage bucket** for remote storage.
* A **Kafka cluster** for the message log.
** For more information on setting up Kafka for usage with XTDB, see the link:config/log/kafka[Kafka configuration^] docs.
* A service account with the necessary permissions to access the storage bucket and Kafka cluster.
* XTDB nodes configured to communicate with the Kafka cluster and Google Cloud Storage.

NOTE: We would recommend running XTDB in a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster, which provides a managed Kubernetes environment in Google Cloud.

[#terraform]
== Terraform Templates

To set up a basic version of the required infrastructure, we provide a set of Terraform templates specifically designed for Google Cloud.

These can be fetched from the XTDB repository using the following command:

```bash
terraform init -from-module github.com/xtdb/xtdb.git//google-cloud/terraform
```

=== Required APIs

To deploy the required infrastructure, we need to ensure the following APIs are enabled on the Google Cloud project:

* Cloud Storage API
* IAM API
* Compute Engine API
* Kubernetes Engine API

=== Required Permissions

In order for the terraform templates to setup the required infrastructure, the following permissions are required for the logged in user:

* `Storage Admin` - Required for creating and managing Google Cloud Storage buckets.
* `Service Account Admin` - Required for creating and managing service accounts.
* `Kubernetes Engine Admin` - Required for creating and managing Google Kubernetes Engine clusters and their resources.

=== Resources

By default, running the templates will deploy the following infrastructure:

* **IAM Service Account** for accessing required Google Cloud resources.
* **Google Cloud Storage Bucket** for remote storage.
** Configured with associated resources using the link:https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-google-modules/cloud-storage/google/latest[**GoogleCloud/storage-bucket**^] Terraform module.
** Adds required permissions to the Service Account.
* **Virtual Private Cloud Network** for the XTDB GKE cluster.
** Configured with associated resources using the link:https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-google-modules/network/google/latest[**GoogleCloud/network**^] Terraform module.
* **Google Kubernetes Engine Cluster** for running the XTDB resources.
** Configured with associated resources using the link:https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-google-modules/kubernetes-engine/google/latest[**GoogleCloud/kubernetes-engine**^] Terraform module.

=== Configuration

In order to customize the deployment, we provide a number of pre-defined variables within the `terraform.tfvars` file.
These variables can be modified to tailor the infrastructure to your specific needs.

The following variables are **required** to be set:

* `project_id`: The Google Cloud project ID to deploy the resources to.
* `storage_bucket_name`: A globally unique name for your Google Cloud Storage bucket.

For more advanced usage, the Terraform templates themselves can be modified to suit your specific requirements.

[#helm]
== `xtdb-google-cloud` Helm Charts

For setting up a production-ready XTDB cluster on Google Cloud, we provide a **Helm** chart built specifically for Google Cloud environments.

=== Pre-requisites

To enable XTDB nodes to access a Google Cloud Storage bucket securely, a Kubernetes Service Account (KSA) must be set up and linked to a Google Cloud IAM service account using link:https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity#using_from_your_code[**Workload Identity Federation**^].

==== Setting Up the Kubernetes Service Account:

Create the Kubernetes Service Account in the target namespace:

```bash
kubectl create serviceaccount xtdb-service-account --namespace xtdb-deployment
```

==== Binding the IAM Service Account

Fetch the IAM service account email (in the format `<IAM_SA_NAME>@<PROJECT_ID>.iam.gserviceaccount.com`) and bind the `roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser` role to the Kubernetes Service Account:

```bash
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding <iam_service_account_email> \
  --role roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser \
  --member "serviceAccount:<project_id>.svc.id.goog[xtdb-deployment/xtdb-service-account]"
```

==== Annotating the Kubernetes Service Account

Annotate the Kubernetes Service Account to establish the link between GKE and Google IAM:

```bash
kubectl annotate serviceaccount xtdb-service-account \
  --namespace xtdb-deployment \
  iam.gke.io/gcp-service-account=<iam_service_account_email>
```

=== Installation

The Helm chart can be installed directly from the link:https://github.com/xtdb/xtdb/pkgs/container/helm-xtdb-google-cloud[**Github Container Registry** releases]. 

This will use the default configuration for the deployment, setting any required values as needed:  

```bash
helm install xtdb-google-cloud oci://ghcr.io/xtdb/helm-xtdb-google-cloud \
  --version 2.0.0-snapshot \
  --namespace xtdb-deployment \
  --set xtdbConfig.serviceAccount=xtdb-service-account \
  --set xtdbConfig.gcpProjectId=<project_id> \
  --set xtdbConfig.gcpBucket=<bucket_name> 
```

We provide a number of parameters for configuring numerous parts of the deployment, see the link:https://github.com/xtdb/xtdb/tree/main/google-cloud/helm[`values.yaml` file] or call `helm show values`:

```bash
helm show values oci://ghcr.io/xtdb/helm-xtdb-google-cloud \
  --version 2.0.0-snapshot 
```

=== Resources

By default, the following resources are deployed by the Helm chart:

* A `ConfigMap` containing the XTDB YAML configuration.
* A `StatefulSet` containing a configurable number of XTDB nodes, using the link:#docker-image[**xtdb-google-cloud** docker image]
* A `LoadBalancer` Kubernetes service to expose the XTDB cluster to the internet.

=== Pulling the Chart Locally

The chart can also be pulled from the **Github Container Registry**, allowing further configuration of the templates within:

```bash
helm pull oci://ghcr.io/xtdb/helm-xtdb-google-cloud \
  --version 2.0.0-snapshot \
  --untar
```

[#docker-image]
== `xtdb-google-cloud` Docker Image

The https://github.com/xtdb/xtdb/pkgs/container/xtdb-google-cloud[**xtdb-google-cloud**^] image is optimized for running XTDB in Google Cloud environments and is deployed on every release to XTDB.

By default, it will use Google Cloud Storage for storage and Kafka for the message log, including dependencies for both.

=== Configuration

The following environment variables are used to configure the `xtdb-google-cloud` image:

[cols="2,3", options="header"]
|===
| Variable              | Description

| `KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS`
| Kafka bootstrap server containing the XTDB topics.

| `XTDB_LOG_TOPIC`
| Kafka topic to be used as the XTDB log.

| `XTDB_GCP_PROJECT_ID`
| GCP project ID containing the bucket.

| `XTDB_GCP_BUCKET`
| Name of the Google Cloud Storage bucket used for remote storage.

| `XTDB_GCP_LOCAL_DISK_CACHE_PATH`
| Path to the local disk cache.

| `XTDB_NODE_ID`
| Persistent node id for labelling Prometheus metrics.
|===

You can also link:/ops/troubleshooting#loglevel[set the XTDB log level] using environment variables.

=== Using a Custom Node Configuration

For advanced usage, XTDB allows the above YAML configuration to be overridden to customize the running node's system/modules.

In order to override the default configuration:

. Mount a custom YAML configuration file to the container.
. Override the `COMMAND` of the docker container to use the custom configuration file, ie:
+
[source, bash]
----
CMD ["-f", "/path/to/custom-config.yaml"]
----


[#storage]
== Google Cloud Storage

https://cloud.google.com/storage?hl=en[**Google Cloud Storage**^] can be used as a shared object-store for XTDB's link:config/storage#remote[remote storage^] module.

=== Infrastructure Requirements

To use Google Cloud Storage as the object store, the following infrastructure is required:

. A **Google Cloud Storage bucket**
. A **custom role** with the necessary permissions for XTDB to use the bucket:
+
[source,yaml]
----
type: gcp-types/iam-v1:projects.roles
name: custom-role-name
properties:
  parent: projects/project-name
  roleId: custom-role-name
  role:
    title: XTDB Custom Role
    stage: GA
    description: Custom role for XTDB - allows usage of containers.
    includedPermissions:
      - storage.objects.create
      - storage.objects.delete
      - storage.objects.get
      - storage.objects.list
      - storage.objects.update
      - storage.buckets.get
----

=== Authentication

XTDB uses Google's "Application Default Credentials" for authentication. 
See the https://github.com/googleapis/google-auth-library-java/blob/main/README.md#application-default-credentials[Google Cloud documentation^] for setup instructions.

=== Configuration

To use the Google Cloud module, include the following in your node configuration:

[source,yaml]
----
storage: !Remote
  objectStore: !GoogleCloud
    ## -- required

    # The name of the GCP project containing the bucket
    # (Can be set as an !Env value)
    projectId: xtdb-project

    # The Cloud Storage bucket to store documents
    # (Can be set as an !Env value)
    bucket: xtdb-bucket

    ## -- optional
    # A file path to prefix all files with
    # - for example, if "foo" is provided, all XTDB files will be under a "foo" sub-directory
    # (Can be set as an !Env value)
    # prefix: my-xtdb-node

  localDiskCache: /var/cache/xtdb/object-store

[#protecting-data]
== Protecting XTDB Data

Google Cloud Storage provides link:https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/availability-durability[strong durability guarantees^] (up to 11 9s), but it does not protect against operator error or access misconfiguration.

To minimize risk:

* Enable link:https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/object-versioning[Object Versioning^] — allows recovery of deleted or overwritten objects
* Enable link:https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/soft-delete[Soft Delete^] — provides temporary protection against deletion for a configured retention period
* Use link:https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/locations#considerations[Multi- or Dual-Region Buckets^] for cross-region redundancy
* Apply lifecycle and retention policies with care
* Restrict access using fine-grained IAM permissions and scoped service accounts

For shared guidance on storage backup strategies, see the link:/ops/backup-and-restore/overview[Backup Overview^].

[#backup]
== Backing Up XTDB Data

XTDB storage files in Google Cloud Storage are immutable and ideally suited for snapshot-based backup strategies.

To perform a full backup:

* Back up the entire GCS bucket or prefix used by XTDB
* Ensure all objects associated with the latest flushed block are present
* Avoid copying in-progress files — only finalized storage files are valid for recovery

Google Cloud does not currently offer native snapshotting for Cloud Storage. Instead, use:

* link:https://cloud.google.com/storage-transfer-service[Storage Transfer Service^] — for scheduled or on-demand full/incremental backups across buckets or regions
* link:https://cloud.google.com/workflows[Cloud Workflows^] or link:https://cloud.google.com/scheduler[Cloud Scheduler^] — to automate transfer or backup logic
