title: Azure Blob Storage
---
Azure Blob Storage can be used as a shared object-store for XTDB's remote storage module.

[NOTE]
== Setup

First, ensure the `com.xtdb/xtdb-azure` Maven dependency is added to your XTDB node.

=== Infrastructure

[#resource-manager]
[NOTE]
.Resource Manager template
====
We provide a https://github.com/xtdb/xtdb/blob/main/modules/azure/azure-resource-manager/azure-stack.json[parameterized 'Azure Resource Manager' stack] to help set up everything that you need.
====

To use Azure Blob Storage as the object store, the following infrastructure is required:

. An **Azure Storage Account**, containing a **Storage Account Container**.
[source,json]
----
{
  "permissions": [
    {
      "actions": [
        "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers/write",
        "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers/delete",
        "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers/read",
      ],
      "notActions": [],
      "dataActions": [
        "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers/blobs/read",
        "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers/blobs/write",
        "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers/blobs/delete",
        "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers/blobs/add/action",
        "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers/blobs/move/action"
      ],
      "notDataActions": []
    }
  ]
}
----

=== Authentication

Authentication is done via the Azure SDK, which uses the *DefaultAzureCredential*. See the https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/java/api/com.azure.identity.defaultazurecredential?view=azure-java-stable[Azure Documentation] for setup instructions.

== Configuration

To use the Azure module, include the following in your node configuration:

[source,yaml]
----
storage: !Remote
  objectStore: !Azure
    # -- required

    # --- At least one of storageAccount or storageAccountEndpoint is required

    # The name of the storage account which has the storage container
    # (Can be set as an !Env value)
    storageAccount: storage-account

    # The full endpoint of the storage account which has the storage container
    # (Can be set as an !Env value)
    # storageAccountEndpoint: https://storage-account.privatelink.blob.core.windows.net
    
    # The name of the blob storage container to be used as the object store
    # (Can be set as an !Env value)
    container: xtdb-container

    # -- optional
    # A file path to prefix all of your files with
    # - for example, if "foo" is provided, all XTDB files will be located under a "foo" sub-directory
    # (Can be set as an !Env value)
    # prefix: my-xtdb-node
    #
    # Azure Client ID of a User Assigned Managed Identity -
    # required when using them for authentication to Azure Services ie, inside of an Azure App Container.  
    # (Can be set as an !Env value)
    # userManagedIdentityClientId: user-managed-identity-client-id
