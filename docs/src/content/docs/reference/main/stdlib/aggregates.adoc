title: Aggregate functions
---

Aggregate functions can be used within `SELECT` clause.

In line with the SQL spec:

* Except in the case of `COUNT(*)`, null values in the column are removed before the aggregate is calculated.
* Without grouping columns, aggregate functions will always return exactly one row - if the input column is empty (after nulls have been removed), the result will be a single row containing a null value.

== Numeric aggregate functions

* `AVG([ALL] xs)` (average (mean) of all values)
* `AVG(DISTINCT xs)` (average (mean) of distinct values)
* `COUNT([ALL] xs)` (count of rows that contain non-null values)
* `COUNT(DISTINCT xs)` (count of distinct values)
* `COUNT(*)` (row count)
* `MAX([ALL|DISTINCT] xs)` (maximum value)
* `MIN([ALL|DISTINCT] xs)` (minimum value)
* `STDDEV_POP(xs)` (population standard deviation)
* `STDDEV_SAMP(xs)` (sample standard deviation)
* `SUM([ALL] xs)` (sum of values)
* `SUM(DISTINCT xs)` (sum of distinct values)
* `VAR_POP(xs)` (population variance)
* `VAR_SAMP(xs)` (sample variance)

Note:

* `MIN`/`MAX` aggregates are not yet supported on string values.

== Boolean aggregate functions

* `BOOL_AND(xs)` (true if all values are true; false otherwise)
* `BOOL_OR(xs)` (false if all values are false; true otherwise)

Note: In keeping with Postgres, we rename `ALL` and `ANY` to `BOOL_AND` and `BOOL_OR` to avoid confusion with the logical operators.

== Composite-type aggregate functions

* `ARRAY_AGG(xs)` (return an array of all of the input values)
