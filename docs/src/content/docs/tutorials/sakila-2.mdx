In [part 1](/tutorials/sakila-1), we covered deleted data, and the fact that in an immutable database, data is never truly gone.

In this part, we'll expand more
on the idea of querying the timeline.

Let's use a single record for this example.

Let's pretend the first version is inserted on `2024-01-01`.

<Fiddle magicContext="my-context">
  <Txs systemTime="2024-01-01"
       txs="INSERT INTO product (xt$id, name, price)
            VALUES
            (1, 'Pendleton Electric Bicycle', 340)" />
  <Query hidden={true} q="SELECT * FROM xt$txs ORDER BY xt$txs.xt$tx_time DESC LIMIT 1" />
</Fiddle>

(Notice how we don't have to create a database table explicitly, or tell our database about the columns - the database will learn the schema from the data we give it)

Let's query this product:

<Fiddle magicContext="my-context">
  <Query q="SELECT * FROM product" />
</Fiddle>

A month later on `2024-02-01`, we decide to update the price of the product.


<Fiddle magicContext="my-context">
  <Txs systemTime="2024-02-01"
       txs="UPDATE product
            SET price = 360
            WHERE product.name = 'Pendleton Electric Bicycle'" />
  <Query hidden={true} q="SELECT * FROM xt$txs ORDER BY xt$txs.xt$tx_time DESC LIMIT 1" />
</Fiddle>

Let's check the new price:

<Fiddle magicContext="my-context">
  <Query q="SELECT * FROM product" />
</Fiddle>

A month later on `2024-03-01`, with part costs still increasing, we increase the price again.

<Fiddle magicContext="my-context">
  <Txs systemTime="2024-03-01"
       txs="UPDATE product
            SET price = 400
            WHERE product.name = 'Pendleton Electric Bicycle'" />
  <Query q="SELECT * FROM product" />
</Fiddle>

Let's say we need to do an audit query, and we need to know
the price of every product as of `2024-01-15`.

<Fiddle magicContext="my-context">
  <Query q="SELECT * FROM product FOR VALID_TIME AS OF DATE '2024-01-15'" />
</Fiddle>

Here you can see we have the correct historical price for `2024-01-15`, which is 340

Now lets say our the CFO wants to how the prices have increased over Q1?

<Fiddle magicContext="my-context">
  <Query q="SELECT product.*, product.xt$valid_from, product.xt$valid_to
            FROM product
            FOR ALL VALID_TIME
            ORDER BY product.xt$valid_from" />
</Fiddle>

When did the bicycle price first exceed $350 ?

<Fiddle magicContext="my-context">
  <Query q="SELECT product.*, product.xt$valid_from, product.xt$valid_to
            FROM product
            FOR ALL VALID_TIME
            WHERE product.price > 350
            ORDER BY product.xt$valid_from
            LIMIT 1" />
</Fiddle>

Yes, it was the price change of `2024-02-01` where the bicycle's
price exceeded $350.

## Conclusion

We've shown that it's possible to view the past history of records
in our database without creating any special views, audit tables or
workarounds.

Let's move ahead to [part 3](/tutorials/sakila-3).
