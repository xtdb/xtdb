Imagine a system that stores product data.

Suppose someone decides to delete a product from our database.

```sql
DELETE FROM product WHERE product.id = 1;
```

In a traditional database, this record is now gone for good, and
unrecoverable (except for restoring from backups, which is
expensive, time-consuming and notoriously unreliable!).

One common workaround is the use of a status column:

```sql
UPDATE product SET status = 'UNAVAILABLE'
WHERE product.id = 1;
```

The downside of this approach is that *all* queries to the product
table now need to be aware of this workaround and add explicit
clauses to their queries.

```sql
SELECT * FROM product WHERE status <> 'UNAVAILABLE'
```

Another downside is that we no longer have any historic record of
when a status changed.

*This is a trivial example but one that clearly demonstrates the
fragility and complexity of managing time in data systems.*

## Using an immutable database

Using an immutable database we keep everything, including the
history of any change to the database. Therefore, we can get back
deleted data.

For example, let's set up a scenario by inserting some product records:

Let's pretend the day we are inserting these records is 2024-01-01.

<Fiddle magicContext="my-context">
  <Txs systemTime="2024-01-01"
       txs="INSERT INTO product (xt$id, name)
            VALUES
            (1, 'Pendleton Electric Bicycle'),
            (2, 'Bicycle Pump')" />
  <Query hidden={true} q="SELECT * FROM xt$txs ORDER BY xt$txs.xt$tx_time DESC LIMIT 1" />
</Fiddle>

Let's query these products:

<Fiddle magicContext="my-context">
  <Query q="SELECT * FROM product" />
</Fiddle>

A month later, someone deletes the product.

<Fiddle magicContext="my-context">
  <Txs systemTime="2024-02-01"
       txs="DELETE FROM product WHERE product.name = 'Pendleton Electric Bicycle'" />
  <Query hidden={true} q="SELECT * FROM xt$txs ORDER BY xt$txs.xt$tx_time DESC LIMIT 1" />
</Fiddle>

Let's check that the bicycle is no longer in our database:

<Fiddle magicContext="my-context">
  <Query q="SELECT * FROM product" />
</Fiddle>

The product is gone! Oh no!

However, don't worry. Since the database is immutable, we can make
a historical query different time. We can do this by adding a
qualifier to the query:

<Fiddle magicContext="my-context">
  <Query q="SELECT *
            FROM product
            FOR VALID_TIME AS OF DATE '2024-01-01'" />
</Fiddle>

## Conclusion

We've shown that it's possible to use standard SQL to make
historical queries against an immutable database, to bring back
deleted data.
