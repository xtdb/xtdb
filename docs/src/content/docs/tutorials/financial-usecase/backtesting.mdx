Backtesting is a general term that refers to testing a predictive model on historical data. It is critical for regression-testing changes to models before they are promoted into production.

Let's assume we have some trade data in our risk system that also serves as an authoritative platform for regression testing:

<Xtplay magicContext="my-context">
  <Txs systemTime="2024-04-01"
       txs={`
INSERT INTO commodity_trades
(_id, symbol, quantity, price, _valid_from, trader_name)
VALUES
(1, 'XAU:CUR', 100, 1800.50, TIMESTAMP '2024-03-08 10:00:00', 'John Doe'),   -- Gold
(2, 'XAG:CUR', 500, 25.30, TIMESTAMP '2024-03-08 11:00:00', 'Jane Smith'),   -- Silver
(3, 'CL1:COM', 300, 60.00, TIMESTAMP '2024-03-08 11:30:00', 'Mike Johnson'), -- Crude Oil
(4, 'NG1:COM', 400, 3.10, TIMESTAMP '2024-03-08 12:45:00', 'Emily White'),   -- Natural Gas
(5, 'W1:COM', 250, 5.20, TIMESTAMP '2024-03-08 13:05:00', 'Alex Green')      -- Wheat
`} />
  <Query q={`
SELECT t.*, _valid_from
FROM commodity_trades as t
ORDER BY _id
`} />
</Xtplay>

The system also contains the following history of prices:

<Xtplay magicContext="my-context">
  <Txs systemTime="2024-04-01"
       txs={`
INSERT INTO commodity_spot_prices
(_id, spot_price, _valid_from)
VALUES
('XAU:CUR', 1804.30, TIMESTAMP '2024-03-08 16:00:00'),
('XAU:CUR', 1805.50, TIMESTAMP '2024-03-08 17:00:00'),
('XAG:CUR', 25.55, TIMESTAMP '2024-03-08 16:00:00'),
('XAG:CUR', 25.35, TIMESTAMP '2024-03-08 17:00:00'),
('CL1:COM', 61.10, TIMESTAMP '2024-03-08 16:00:00'),
('CL1:COM', 61.00, TIMESTAMP '2024-03-08 17:00:00'),
('NG1:COM', 3.05, TIMESTAMP '2024-03-08 16:00:00'),
('NG1:COM', 3.15, TIMESTAMP '2024-03-08 17:00:00'),
('W1:COM', 5.30, TIMESTAMP '2024-03-08 16:00:00'),
('W1:COM', 5.25, TIMESTAMP '2024-03-08 17:00:00')
`} />
  <Query q={`
SELECT _id, spot_price, _valid_from
FROM commodity_spot_prices
`} />
</Xtplay>

The backtesting processes are able to simulate querying as-of successive moments in time by efficiently querying the entire database without the need for explicit snapshots, using SQL:

<Xtplay magicContext="my-context">
  <Query q={`
SELECT
    ct._id as trade_id,
    ct.symbol,
    ct.quantity,
    ct.price as trade_price,
    csp.spot_price,
    ct._valid_from as trade_timestamp,
    ct.trader_name,
    csp._valid_from as spot_price_timestamp
FROM
    commodity_trades
    FOR VALID_TIME AS OF TIMESTAMP '2024-03-08 16:30:00'
    AS ct
INNER JOIN
    commodity_spot_prices
    FOR VALID_TIME AS OF TIMESTAMP '2024-03-08 16:30:00'
    AS csp
ON
    ct.symbol = csp._id
`} />
</Xtplay>

This as-of view across all database tables in the system can encompass all reference data and complete portfolio states, which thereby maximises the number of useful signals available to the model.
