title: Understanding P&L and Risk
---

Let's imagine you're a commodities trader.

Every day you arrive at your desk and look at your Risk and [P&L reports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PnL_explained), telling you the value and risk of your trading positions.

Whenever something in those reports doesn't look quite like what you were expecting you have to do some counterfactual exploration of all the various inputs to understand what's happened.

For example, let's assume that over the course of the day your colleagues have made the following trades:

<Xtplay magicContext="my-context">
  <Txs systemTime="2024-04-01"
       txs={`
INSERT INTO commodity_trades
(_id, symbol, quantity, price, _valid_from, trader_name)
VALUES
(1, 'XAU:CUR', 100, 1800.50, TIMESTAMP '2024-03-08 10:00:00', 'John Doe'),   -- Gold
(2, 'XAG:CUR', 500, 25.30, TIMESTAMP '2024-03-08 11:00:00', 'Jane Smith'),   -- Silver
(3, 'CL1:COM', 300, 60.00, TIMESTAMP '2024-03-08 11:30:00', 'Mike Johnson'), -- Crude Oil
(4, 'NG1:COM', 400, 3.10, TIMESTAMP '2024-03-08 12:45:00', 'Emily White'),   -- Natural Gas
(5, 'W1:COM', 250, 5.20, TIMESTAMP '2024-03-08 13:05:00', 'Alex Green')      -- Wheat
`} />
  <Query q={`
SELECT t.*, _valid_from
FROM commodity_trades as t
ORDER BY _id
`} />
</Xtplay>

At the end of the day, the market closes with the following prices:

<Xtplay magicContext="my-context">
  <Txs systemTime="2024-04-01"
       txs={`
INSERT INTO commodity_spot_prices
(_id, spot_price, _valid_from)
VALUES
('XAU:CUR', 1805.50, TIMESTAMP '2024-03-08 17:00:00'),
('XAG:CUR', 25.35, TIMESTAMP '2024-03-08 17:00:00'),
('CL1:COM', 61.00, TIMESTAMP '2024-03-08 17:00:00'),
('NG1:COM', 3.15, TIMESTAMP '2024-03-08 17:00:00'),
('W1:COM', 5.25, TIMESTAMP '2024-03-08 17:00:00')
`} />
  <Query q={`
SELECT _id, spot_price, _valid_from
FROM commodity_spot_prices
`} />
</Xtplay>

Now we want to price our risk and P&L for the end of this week.
Let's extract the information we need to calculate our P&L:

<Xtplay magicContext="my-context">
  <Query q={`
SELECT
    ct._id as trade_id,
    ct.symbol,
    ct.quantity,
    ct.price as trade_price,
    csp.spot_price,
    ct._valid_from as trade_timestamp,
    ct.trader_name,
    csp._valid_from as spot_price_timestamp
FROM
    commodity_trades ct
INNER JOIN
    commodity_spot_prices csp
ON
    ct.symbol = csp._id
`} />
</Xtplay>

For the purposes of this simple example, we'll just use SQL to calculate the P&L.
However, in the 'real world', we'd usually have much more complex objects (yield curves, etc.) and would use a quant pricing library.

<Xtplay magicContext="my-context">
  <Query q={`
SELECT
    SUM((csp.spot_price - ct.price) * ct.quantity) as pnl
FROM
    commodity_trades ct
INNER JOIN
    commodity_spot_prices csp
ON
    ct.symbol = csp._id
`} />
  <OutputTraffic />
</Xtplay>

So far so good.

On the Monday morning, after a pleasant weekend's break, you come back into the trading floor.

<Xtplay magicContext="my-context">
  <Txs systemTime="2024-04-01"
       txs={`
INSERT INTO commodity_trades (_id, symbol, quantity, price, _valid_from, trader_name)
VALUES
(6, 'XAU:CUR', 1000, 2590.40, TIMESTAMP '2024-03-11 10:00:00', 'John Doe'),
(7, 'XAG:CUR', 30, 27.30, TIMESTAMP '2024-03-11 11:00:00', 'Jane Smith')
`} />
  <Query q={`
SELECT t.*, _valid_from
FROM commodity_trades as t
ORDER BY _id
`} />
</Xtplay>

At the end of this Monday trading day, the market closes with the following prices:

<Xtplay magicContext="my-context">
  <Txs systemTime="2024-04-01"
       txs={`
INSERT INTO commodity_spot_prices (_id, spot_price, _valid_from)
VALUES
('XAU:CUR', 2010.50, TIMESTAMP '2024-03-11 17:00:00'),
('XAG:CUR', 25.25, TIMESTAMP '2024-03-11 17:00:00'),
('CL1:COM', 62.00, TIMESTAMP '2024-03-11 17:00:00'),
('NG1:COM', 3.17, TIMESTAMP '2024-03-11 17:00:00'),
('W1:COM', 5.27, TIMESTAMP '2024-03-11 17:00:00')
`} />
  <Query q={`
SELECT _id, spot_price, _valid_from
FROM commodity_spot_prices
`} />
</Xtplay>

We now recalculate our new P&L:

<Xtplay magicContext="my-context">
  <Query q={`
SELECT
    SUM((csp.spot_price - ct.price) * ct.quantity) as pnl
FROM
    commodity_trades ct
INNER JOIN
    commodity_spot_prices csp
ON
    ct.symbol = csp._id
`} />
  <OutputTraffic />
</Xtplay>

Oh no!

What if we could ignore the today's trades, and just see what our closing position on Friday would have looked like in the market at the end of today.

<Xtplay autoLoad magicContext="my-context">
  <QueryTemplate q={`
SELECT
    SUM((csp.spot_price - ct.price) * ct.quantity) as pnl
FROM
    commodity_trades FOR VALID_TIME AS OF {{tradesFrom}} ct
INNER JOIN
    commodity_spot_prices FOR VALID_TIME AS OF {{pricesFrom}} csp
ON
    ct.symbol = csp._id
`} />
  <div class="flex flex-col">
    <div class="flex flex-row gap-2">
    <label>Trades:</label>
    <DateRange class="w-full flex-1"
               name="tradesFrom"
               dates={["2024-03-08T10:00",
                       "2024-03-08T11:00",
                       "2024-03-08T11:30",
                       "2024-03-08T12:45",
                       "2024-03-08T13:05",
                       "2024-03-11T10:00",
                       "2024-03-11T11:00"]}
               value="2024-03-11T11:00" />
    </div>
    <div class="flex flex-row gap-2">
    <label>Spot Prices:</label>
    <DateRange class="w-full flex-1"
               name="pricesFrom"
               dates={["2024-03-08T17:00",
                       "2024-03-11T17:00"]}
               value="2024-03-11T17:00" />
    </div>
  </div>
  <OutputTraffic />
</Xtplay>

We have now established that today's trades must be causing the dramatic P&L change.
