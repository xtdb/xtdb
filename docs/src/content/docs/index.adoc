title: Welcome to XTDB!
---

XTDB is a bitemporal, dynamic database, queryable with SQL and XTQL, that reduces the time and cost of building and maintaining safe systems of record.
It is free-to-use and open-source, under the https://opensource.org/license/mpl-2-0/[MPL license^].

This is the documentation site for XTDB version 2, which is currently in early access.
For documentation on the stable, production-ready 1.x releases of XTDB, see link:https://v1-docs.xtdb.com[here^].

To quickly get up-and-running, check out our link:/intro/getting-started[getting started] guide.

For the time being, XTDB is accessible through our HTTP API and Clojure SDK - we are hard at work on SDKs for Java/Kotlin, JavaScript, Python and many more, which will be available shortly.
