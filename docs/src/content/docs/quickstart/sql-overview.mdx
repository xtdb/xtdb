## The Basics

### Insert a row into a new table

<TabbedExample>
  <div slot="1">
    <Aside title="'XT Play' allows you to try out XTDB live in your browser!">Feel free to edit the SQL in any of these boxes, just be aware that changes you make in one box don't carry over to the next.
    <details style="display: contents"><summary>Details...</summary><ul>
<li>columns are ordered alphanumerically (this restriction will be lifted [soon](https://github.com/xtdb/xt-fiddle/issues/42))</li>
<li>you can click on the 'Open in xt-play' link beneath a given instance to see the full context and to experiment more freely</li>
<li>all XT Play instances execute statelessly - a new ephemeral cloud database instance is summoned into being every time you press 'Run' (using AWS Lambda)</li></ul></details></Aside>
    <Xtplay magicContext="my-context">
      <Txs systemTime="2024-01-01"
	   txs="INSERT INTO people (_id, name) VALUES (6, 'fred')" />
      <Query hidden={true} q="SELECT * FROM xt.txs ORDER BY system_time DESC LIMIT 1" />
    </Xtplay>
  </div>
  <Card slot="2">
If you don't already have XTDB running, follow the brief install steps described in [Installation via Docker](/intro/installation-via-docker).

To run your first INSERT transaction, simply enter the following SQL statement into the `psql` prompt, press return, and you will see:

```sql
user=> INSERT INTO people (_id, name) VALUES (6, 'fred');
INSERT 0 0
```

Note that XTDB doesn't currently return information about the number of rows inserted or modified by a statement when using `psql`.
  </Card>
</TabbedExample>

Things to note:
<ul><li>Tables in XTDB may be created dynamically during `INSERT`, where all columns and types are inferred automatically.</li><li>The only schema requirement is that every table in XTDB requires a user-provided `_id` primary key column, but all other columns are optional and dynamically typed by default. This means each row in XTDB can offer the flexibility of a document in a document database.</li><li>The `_` prefix convention (e.g. `_id`) is used for reserved columns and tables that XTDB handles automatically. For full details see [How XTDB works](/intro/data-model).</li></ul>

### Query for that same row

Querying this data back again is a simple matter of:

<TabbedExample>
  <div slot="1">
    <Xtplay magicContext="my-context">
      <Query q="SELECT * FROM people" />
    </Xtplay>
  </div>
  <Card slot="2">
```sql
user=> SELECT * FROM people;
 _id | name
-----+------
   6 | fred
(1 row)
```
  </Card>
</TabbedExample>

### Evolve the table

If we now INSERT another row with a slightly different shape, we can see that XTDB automatically handles the implicitly extended schema and allows us to return both rows:

<TabbedExample>
  <Xtplay magicContext="my-context" slot="1">
    <Txs systemTime="2024-01-02"
         txs={`
INSERT INTO people (_id, name, likes)
  VALUES (9, 'bob', ['fishing', 3.14, {nested:'data'}])`}/>
    <Query q="SELECT * FROM people" />
  </Xtplay>
  <Card slot="2">
```sql
user=> INSERT INTO people (_id, name, likes)
  VALUES (9, 'bob', ['fishing', 3.14, {nested:'data'}]);
INSERT 0 0
user=> SELECT * FROM people;
 _id |                likes                | name
-----+-------------------------------------+------
   6 |                                     | fred
   9 | ["fishing",3.14,{"nested":"data"}] | bob
(2 rows)
```
  <Aside>Due to Postgres' lack of support for polymorphic values and nested structures, the value returned back to the client in the `likes` column is actually a JSON-ified string representation of the data we previously inserted, however all original type information is preserved internally should it be needed.</Aside>
  </Card>
</TabbedExample>

### Handling ‘documents’

XTDB is designed to work with JSON-like nested data as a first-class concept (i.e. not restricted to JSON or JSONB types). This means you can easily handle complex document-like nested data. Here the `RECORDS` syntax, combined with the 'upsert' behavior of the `INSERT`, avoids the chore of having to be explicit about all the individual columns involved:

<TabbedExample>
  <Xtplay magicContext="my-context" slot="1">
    <Txs systemTime="2024-01-03"
         txs={`
INSERT INTO people
  RECORDS {_id: 6,
           name: 'fred',
           info: {contact: [{loc: 'home',
                             tel: '123'},
                            {loc: 'work',
                             tel: '456',
                             registered: DATE '2024-01-01'}]}}
`}/>
    <Query hidden={true} q="SELECT * FROM xt.txs ORDER BY system_time DESC LIMIT 1" />
  </Xtplay>
  <Card slot="2">
```sql
user=> INSERT INTO people RECORDS
{_id: 6,
 name: 'fred',
 info: {contact: [{loc: 'home',
                   tel: '123'},
                  {loc: 'work',
                   tel: '456',
                   registered: DATE '2024-01-01'}]}};
INSERT 0 0
```
  </Card>
</TabbedExample>

You can then query this nested data intuitively:

<TabbedExample>
  <Xtplay magicContext="my-context" slot="1">
    <Query q={`
SELECT (people.info).contact[2].tel
FROM people
  WHERE people.name = 'fred'`} />
  </Xtplay>
  <Card slot="2">
```sql
user=> SELECT (people.info).contact[2].tel
FROM people
  WHERE people.name = 'fred';
 tel
-----
 456
(1 row)
```
  </Card>
</TabbedExample>

You can also observe the inferred schema using the SQL standard's `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` facilities:

<TabbedExample>
  <Xtplay magicContext="my-context" slot="1">
    <Query q={`
SELECT * FROM information_schema.columns`} />
  </Xtplay>
  <Card slot="2">
```sql
user=> SELECT * FROM information_schema.columns;
 column_name |                                                                  data_type                                                                  | table_catalog | table_name | table_schema
-------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------+------------+--------------
 system_time | [:timestamp-tz :micro "UTC"]                                                                                                                | xtdb          | txs        | xt
 committed   | :bool                                                                                                                                       | xtdb          | txs        | xt
 _id         | :i64                                                                                                                                        | xtdb          | txs        | xt
 error       | [:union #{:null :transit}]                                                                                                                  | xtdb          | txs        | xt
 _id         | :i64                                                                                                                                        | xtdb          | people     | public
 name        | :utf8                                                                                                                                       | xtdb          | people     | public
 likes       | [:union #{[:list [:union #{:f64 :utf8 [:struct {nested :utf8}]}]] :null}]                                                                  | xtdb          | people     | public
 info        | [:union #{[:struct {contact [:union #{:null [:list [:struct {loc :utf8, registered [:union #{[:date :day] :null}], tel :utf8}]]}]}] :null}] | xtdb          | people     | public
(8 rows)
```
  </Card>
</TabbedExample>

Capturing fast-changing data may be powerful, but what if we made a mistake somewhere and wanted to undo a change? The thing that makes XTDB _most_ interesting is the approach to immutability and time-travel...

## A log of transactions

XTDB provides a Postgres wire-compatible endpoint that enables developers to re-use many existing tools and drivers that have been built for connecting to real Postgres servers.

A key distinction between interacting with Postgres and interacting with XTDB (e.g. using `psql` or otherwise) is that all clients connected to XTDB operate in a 'stateless' manner that:

1. forces all writes to be fully serialized into a single, system-wide log of durably-recorded transactions and, consequently,
2. precludes the use of 'interactive transactions' (i.e. clients can't run queries in the middle of multi-statement transactions)

The complete transaction history is permanently stored within the system-maintained `xt.txs` table:

<TabbedExample>
  <Xtplay magicContext="my-context" slot="1">
    <Query q={`
SELECT * FROM xt.txs ORDER BY _id DESC LIMIT 20 -- "recent transactions"`} />
  </Xtplay>
  <Card slot="2">
```sql
user=> SELECT * FROM xt.txs ORDER BY _id DESC LIMIT 20;
 _id  | committed | error |         system_time
------+-----------+-------+-------------------------------
 2722 | t         |       | 2024-07-15T12:43:27.345281Z
 1341 | t         |       | 2024-07-15T12:38:12.750543Z
    0 | t         |       | 2024-07-15T12:36:31.310430Z
(3 rows)
```
  </Card>
</TabbedExample>

XTDB relies on the immutable, append-only nature of the log and its timestamps to automatically record all changes across the database. This approach means that queries can use the **reliable ordering** of the log to query **previous states** of the database using nothing more than a timestamp. More on that next!

## Query the past

### Basis: re-run queries against past states without explicit snapshots

Unlike in a typical SQL database, `UPDATE` and `DELETE` operations in XTDB are non-destructive, meaning previous versions of records are retained automatically and previous states of the entire database can be readily accessed.

A query like `SELECT * FROM people` will only show the 'current' version of everything by default.

Let's try deleting `fred` from the database...

<TabbedExample>
  <Xtplay magicContext="my-context" slot="1">
    <Txs systemTime="2024-01-04"
         txs="DELETE FROM people WHERE name = 'fred'" />
    <Query q="SELECT * FROM people" />
  </Xtplay>
  <Card slot="2">
```sql
user=> DELETE FROM people WHERE name = 'fred';
DELETE 0
user=> SELECT * FROM people;
 _id | info |                likes                | name
-----+------+-------------------------------------+------
   9 |      | ["fishing",3.14,{"nested":"data"}] | bob
(1 row)
```
  </Card>
</TabbedExample>

Despite having _seemingly_ deleted the latest version of the `fred` record, the prior two versions are not lost and can be retrieved using a couple of methods.

The simplest way to observe the prior version of the `fred` record is to re-run the exact same query against an earlier 'basis'.

<TabbedExample>
  <Xtplay magicContext="my-context" slot="1">
    <Query q={`
SETTING DEFAULT SYSTEM_TIME TO AS OF DATE '2020-01-01'
SELECT * FROM PEOPLE`} />
  </Xtplay>
  <Card slot="2">
```sql
user=> SETTING DEFAULT SYSTEM_TIME TO AS OF DATE '2020-01-01'
SELECT * FROM PEOPLE;
 _id | info | likes | name
-----+------+-------+------
(0 rows)
```
  </Card>
</TabbedExample>

Here we set the basis for the whole query by adjusting `DEFAULT SYSTEM_TIME`.
This allows us to view exactly what the database looked like at the beginning of 2020.
The mechanics of `SYSTEM_TIME` are discussed in the next section, but they underpin the notion of basis.

As it happens, the database had no records in 2020 so no results are returned.

:::tip
Whenever you do not specify a basis like this, the latest available basis is used implicitly - _every query runs against some basis_.
:::

Now try setting the basis to a point in time shortly after our initial transaction:

<TabbedExample>
  <Xtplay magicContext="my-context" slot="1">
    <Query q={`
SETTING DEFAULT SYSTEM_TIME TO AS OF DATE '2024-01-01' -- (try 02 and 03 also)
SELECT * FROM PEOPLE`} />
  </Xtplay>
  <Card slot="2">
    <Aside type="caution">The timestamp shown here is for illustration only, you should refer to the output of your recent transactions query for a suitable timestamp.
When querying against a real XTDB node (like you are), XTDB sets the `SYSTEM_TIME` of `INSERT`/`UPDATE`s to the current time.
Therefore in the below query you must substitute the date for dates relative to what you see in the `xt.txs` table.</Aside>
```sql
user=> SETTING DEFAULT SYSTEM_TIME TO AS OF TIMESTAMP '2024-07-15T12:37:00'
SELECT * FROM PEOPLE;
 _id | info | likes | name
-----+------+-------+------
   6 |      |       | fred
(1 row)
```
  </Card>
</TabbedExample>

We can see that on the 1st (our first `INSERT`) we have our original `fred` row, but try changing the date to the 2nd and the `bob` row appears!

:::note[Like a pointer to a snapshot]
A basis is similar to a pointer to a snapshot of a previous version of the entire database state, except unlike snapshots in other systems in XTDB there is no copying or explicit snapshot creation required.

A basis is stable and allows you to re-run unmodified queries indefinitely. This is useful for **debugging**, **auditing**, and exposing application data for processing in downstream systems (**generating reports**, **analytics** etc.)
:::

The concept of basis makes querying consistently across a scaled-out cluster of read replicas very simple. Independent applications can use the same basis to observe the same database state, regardless of which XTDB node they are connected to. For more information on the implications of the log-oriented design, see [How XTDB works](/intro/data-model) or take a look at [this blog post](https://engineering.linkedin.com/distributed-systems/log-what-every-software-engineer-should-know-about-real-time-datas-unifying) by LinkedIn Engineering.

### System-Time Columns: automatic time-versioning of rows without audit tables

The mechanism underpinning the basis concept is called 'System Time'. This is what ensures that changes to data in XTDB are immutable, so you always have access to prior states.

The [SQL:2011](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL:2011) model of System Time and 'temporal tables' is baked into the core design of XTDB, and has been simplified such that you don't need to learn new syntax or clutter your SQL to take advantage of the immutability benefits.

This means that all `INSERT`, `UPDATE` and `DELETE`s are automatically versioned - you can write SQL intuitively and never lose data again!

You can avoid ever needing to reach for backups or ETL integrations with data warehousing systems in order to recover or make use of previous data. It also helps avoid complicating application schemas with things like "soft delete" columns, audit tables and append-only tables.

The built-in system-time columns `_system_from` and `_system_to` are hidden from view by default but, when specified, can be accessed on every table using regular SQL:

<TabbedExample>
  <Xtplay magicContext="my-context" slot="1">
    <Query q={`
SELECT name, _system_from
  FROM people`} />
  </Xtplay>
  <Card slot="2">
```sql
user=> SELECT name, _system_from
  FROM people;
 name |         _system_from
------+-------------------------------
 fred | "2024-07-18T13:57:09.910730Z"
 bob  | "2024-07-18T13:27:35.329921Z"
(2 rows)
```
  </Card>
</TabbedExample>

`_system_from` can take the place of the `modified_at` columns found across many application schemas. More details about these columns and how they are maintained can be found in [How XTDB Works](/intro/data-model).

The full system-time history for a set of records in a table can be retrieved by specifying `FOR SYSTEM_TIME ALL` after the table reference:

<TabbedExample>
  <Xtplay magicContext="my-context" slot="1">
    <Query q={`
SELECT name, likes, _system_from, _system_to
  FROM people FOR SYSTEM_TIME ALL`} />
  </Xtplay>
  <Card slot="2">
```sql
user=> SELECT name, likes, _system_from, _system_to
  FROM people FOR SYSTEM_TIME ALL;
 name |                likes                |         _system_from          |          _system_to
------+-------------------------------------+-------------------------------+-------------------------------
 fred |                                     | "2024-07-18T13:57:09.910730Z" | null
 fred |                                     | "2024-07-18T12:49:27.912683Z" | "2024-07-18T13:57:09.910730Z"
 bob  | ["fishing",3.14,{"nested":"data"}] | "2024-07-18T13:27:35.329921Z" | null
(3 rows)
```
  </Card>
</TabbedExample>

You can also run queries against individual tables at specific timestamps using `FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS_OF <timestamp>`, use temporal period operators (`OVERLAPS`, `PRECEDES` etc.) to understand how data has changed over time, and much more - see the [SQL reference documentation](/reference/main/sql/queries).

Here are some useful capabilities these temporal features enable...

### A delta of changes to a table since a given system-time

<TabbedExample>
  <Xtplay magicContext="my-context" slot="1">
    <Query q={`
SELECT name, _system_from, _system_to
  FROM people FOR SYSTEM_TIME BETWEEN DATE '2020-01-01' AND NOW`} />
  </Xtplay>
  <Card slot="2">
```sql
user=> SELECT name, _system_from, _system_to
  FROM people FOR SYSTEM_TIME BETWEEN DATE '2020-01-01' AND NOW;
 name |         _system_from          |          _system_to
------+-------------------------------+-------------------------------
 fred | "2024-07-18T13:57:09.910730Z" | null
 fred | "2024-07-18T12:49:27.912683Z" | "2024-07-18T13:57:09.910730Z"
 bob  | "2024-07-18T13:27:35.329921Z" | null
(3 rows)
```
  </Card>
</TabbedExample>

#### Restore a deleted row

Because XTDB retains history, the regular SQL DELETE statement is essentially performing a 'soft delete' ("An operation in which a flag is used to mark data as unusable, without erasing the data itself from the database" ...but here it's first-class and ubiquitous).

Here's how we can bring `fred` back to being visible and active in our database:

<TabbedExample>
  <Xtplay magicContext="my-context" slot="1">
    <Txs systemTime="2024-01-05"
         txs={`
INSERT INTO people (_id, name, info)
SELECT _id, name, info
  FROM people FOR ALL SYSTEM_TIME
  WHERE _id = 6
  ORDER BY _system_to DESC
  LIMIT 1`}/>
    <Query q="SELECT * FROM people" />
  </Xtplay>
  <Card slot="2">
```sql
user=> INSERT INTO people (_id, name, info)
SELECT _id, name, info
  FROM people FOR ALL SYSTEM_TIME
  WHERE _id = 6
  ORDER BY _system_to DESC
  LIMIT 1;
INSERT 0 0
user=> SELECT * FROM people;
 _id |                                             info                                              |                likes                | name
-----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+------
   6 | {"contact":[{"loc":"home","tel":"123"},{"loc":"work","registered":"2024-01-01","tel":"456"}]} |                                     | fred
   9 |                                                                                               | ["fishing",3.14,{"nested":"data"}] | bob
(2 rows)
```
  </Card>
</TabbedExample>

### ERASE as 'hard' delete

Sometimes you do really want to forget the past though, and for circumstances where data does need to be erased ("hard deleted"), an `ERASE` operation is provided:

<TabbedExample>
  <Xtplay magicContext="my-context" slot="1">
    <Txs systemTime="2024-01-06"
         txs={`
ERASE FROM people WHERE _id = 6`}/>
    <Query q="SELECT * FROM people" />
  </Xtplay>
  <Card slot="2">
```sql
user=> ERASE FROM people WHERE _id = 6;
ERASE 0
user=> SELECT * FROM people;
 _id | info |                likes                | name
-----+------+-------------------------------------+------
   9 |      | ["fishing",3.14,{"nested":"data"}] | bob
(1 row)
```
  </Card>
</TabbedExample>

The ERASE is effective as soon as the transaction is committed - no longer accessible to an application - and under the hood the relevant data is guaranteed to be fully erased only once all background index processing has completed and the changes have been written to the remote object storage.

### Your basic training is almost complete!

With everything covered so far, you are already well-versed in the main benefits of XTDB.

Really there is only one more topic left to examine before you are familiar with all the novel SQL functionality XTDB has to offer...

## Control the timeline

Everything demonstrated so far only scratches the surface of what XTDB can do, given that XTDB is a full SQL implementation with all the implications that has, however there is one further aspect where XTDB is very different to most databases: ubiquitous 'Valid-Time' versioning.

### Valid-Time is for advanced time-travel

In addition to system-time versioning, SQL:2011 also defines 'application-time' versioning. XTDB applies this versioning to all tables and refers to it as valid-time.

Valid-time is a key tool for developers who need to offer time-travel functionality within their applications. It is a rigourously defined model that can help avoid cluttering schemas and queries with bespoke `updated_at`, `deleted_at` and `effective_from` columns (...and all the various TRIGGERs that typically live alongside those).

Developers who try to build useful functionality on top of system-time directly will likely encounter issues with migrations, backfill, and out-of-order ingestion. Valid-time solves these challenges head-on whilst also enabling other advanced usage scenarios:

* *corrections* - curate a timeline of versions with an ability to correct data - an essential capability for applications where recording the full context behind critical decisions is needed
* *global scheduling* - control exactly when data is visible to as-of-now queries by loading data with future valid-time timestamps, without needing to complicate your schema or queries - data can be orchestrated to 'appear' and 'disappear' automatically as wall-clock time progresses

Note that valid-time as provided by XTDB is specifically about the validity (or "effective from" time) of a given row in the table, and not _necessarily_ some other domain conception of time (unless you carefully model it 1:1).

Let's have a glimpse of what can you do with SQL to make use of valid-time...

### INSERT into the past

We can specify the `_valid_from` column during an INSERT statement to record when the organization (i.e. thinking beyond this particular database!) first became aware of the person `carol`:

<TabbedExample>
  <Xtplay magicContext="my-context" slot="1">
    <Txs systemTime="2024-01-07"
         txs={`
INSERT INTO people (_id, name, favorite_color, _valid_from)
  VALUES (2, 'carol', 'blue', DATE '2023-01-01')`}/>
    <Query q="SELECT name, _valid_from FROM people" />
  </Xtplay>
  <Card slot="2">
```sql
user=> INSERT INTO people (_id, name, favorite_color, _valid_from)
  VALUES (2, 'carol', 'blue', DATE '2023-01-01');
INSERT 0 0
user=> SELECT name, _valid_from FROM people;
 name  |          _valid_from
-------+-------------------------------
 carol | "2023-01-01T00:00Z"
 bob   | "2024-07-18T13:27:35.329921Z"
(2 rows)
```
  </Card>
</TabbedExample>

### What did you know?

With backdated information now correctly loaded into XTDB, we can easily verify that we knew `carol` existed in the company records at a time before our current database was even created:

<TabbedExample>
  <Xtplay magicContext="my-context" slot="1">
    <Query q="SELECT * FROM people FOR VALID_TIME AS OF DATE '2023-10-01'" />
  </Xtplay>
  <Card slot="2">
```sql
user=> SELECT * FROM people FOR VALID_TIME AS OF DATE '2023-10-01';
 _id | favorite_color | info | likes | name
-----+----------------+------+-------+-------
   2 | blue           |      |       | carol
(1 row)
```
  </Card>
</TabbedExample>

### When did you know it?

The 'bitemporal' combination of valid-time and system-time columns allows us to readily produce an auditable history about what we claimed to have known in the past:

<TabbedExample>
  <Xtplay magicContext="my-context" slot="1">
    <Txs systemTime="2024-01-08"
         txs={`
INSERT INTO people (_id, name, favorite_color, _valid_from)
  VALUES (2, 'carol', 'red', DATE '2023-09-01')`}/>
    <Query q="SELECT name, favorite_color, _valid_from, _valid_to, _system_from, _system_to
  FROM people FOR VALID_TIME ALL FOR SYSTEM_TIME ALL" />
  </Xtplay>
  <Card slot="2">
```sql
user=> INSERT INTO people (_id, name, favorite_color, _valid_from)
  VALUES (2, 'carol', 'red', DATE '2023-09-01');
INSERT 0 0
user=> SELECT name, favorite_color, _valid_from, _valid_to, _system_from, _system_to
FROM people FOR VALID_TIME ALL FOR SYSTEM_TIME ALL;
 name  | favorite_color |          _valid_from          |      _valid_to      |         _system_from          |          _system_to
-------+----------------+-------------------------------+---------------------+-------------------------------+-------------------------------
 carol | red            | "2023-09-01T00:00Z"           | null                | "2024-07-18T20:09:27.822861Z" | null
 carol | blue           | "2023-01-01T00:00Z"           | "2023-09-01T00:00Z" | "2024-07-18T19:43:53.398249Z" | null
 carol | blue           | "2023-09-01T00:00Z"           | null                | "2024-07-18T19:43:53.398249Z" | "2024-07-18T20:09:27.822861Z"
 bob   |                | "2024-07-18T13:27:35.329921Z" | null                | "2024-07-18T13:27:35.329921Z" | null
(4 rows)
```
  </Card>
</TabbedExample>

### "Please re-run yesterday's report using today's data"

Perhaps most importantly for many applications, we can easily produce and later re-produce _correct_ reports against business-relevant timestamps without having to assemble wildly complex queries or maintain unnecessary ETL infrastructure:

<TabbedExample>
  <Xtplay magicContext="my-context" slot="1">
    <Query q={`
SETTING DEFAULT VALID_TIME AS OF DATE '2023-10-01',
        DEFAULT SYSTEM_TIME AS OF DATE '2024-01-08'
SELECT name, favorite_color , _valid_from, _system_from FROM people`}/>
    </Xtplay>
  <Card slot="2">
```sql
user=> SETTING DEFAULT VALID_TIME AS OF DATE '2023-10-01',
DEFAULT SYSTEM_TIME AS OF DATE '2030-01-01'; -- (some recent/latest timestamp)
SELECT name, favorite_color , _valid_from, _system_from FROM people;
 name  | favorite_color |        _valid_from        |           _system_from
-------+----------------+---------------------------+----------------------------------
 carol | red            | 2023-09-01 00:00:00+00:00 | 2024-07-18 20:09:27.822861+00:00
(1 row)
```
  </Card>
</TabbedExample>

## Summary

XTDB implements a SQL API that closely follows the ISO standard specifications and draws inspiration from Postgres where needed, however unlike most SQL systems XTDB:

* does not require an explicit schema to be declared before inserting data (i.e. there's no explicit `CREATE TABLE` [DDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_definition_language) statement) - tables may be created dynamically via an initial INSERT statement, along with any supplied columns and inferrable type information - schema automatically evolves over time as data changes
* handles semi-structured 'document' data natively, with deeply nested union types ('objects') and arrays
* operates on top of a durable log to help underpin scalable and reliable information systems
* maintains various 'bitemporal' columns globally across all tables to preserve history
* offers powerful temporal query syntax for rich analysis of historical data
