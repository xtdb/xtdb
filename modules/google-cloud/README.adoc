# Google Cloud Module

Within our XTDB node, we can make use of Google Cloud Services for certain purposes. Currently, we can:

* Use *Google Cloud Storage* as the XTDB Object Store.

### Project Dependency 

In order to use any of the Azure services, you will need to include a dependency on the xtdb.azure module.

_deps.edn_
```
com.xtdb.labs/xtdb-google-cloud {:mvn/version "2.0.0-SNAPSHOT"}
```

_pom.xml_
```
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.xtdb.labs</groupId>
    <artifactId>xtdb-google-cloud</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

### Authentication

Authentication for both the document store and checkpoint store components within the module is handled via Google’s "Application Default Credentials" - see the https://github.com/googleapis/google-auth-library-java/blob/main/README.md#application-default-credentials[*relevant documentation*] to get set up. You will need to setup authentication using any of the methods listed within the Azure documentation to be able to make use of the operations inside the modules. 

## Google Cloud Storage Object Store

We can swap out the implementation of the object store with one based on Azure Blob Storage. To do so, we add the `xtdb.google-cloud/blob-object-store` key within the integrant config for our node, alongside any config:
```clojure
{
  ...
  {:xtdb.google-cloud/blob-object-store {:project-id "your-project-id"
                                         :bucket "your-storage-bucket"}}
  ...
}
```

### Parameters

These are the following parameters that can be passed within the config for our `xtdb.google-cloud/blob-object-store`:
[cols="1,1,2,1"]
|===
| *Name* | *Type* | *Description* | *Required?*
| `project-id`
| String
| The name of the GCP project that the bucket is contained within
| Yes

| `bucket`
| String 
| The cloud storage bucket which the documents will be stored within
| Yes

|`prefix`
| String 
| A string to prefix all of your files with - for example, if "foo" is provided all xtdb files will be located under a "foo" directory
| No
