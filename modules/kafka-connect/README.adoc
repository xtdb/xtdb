which is an implementation of
`org.apache.kafka.connect.sink.SinkConnector` and
`crux.kafka.connect.CruxSourceConnector` which is an implementation of
`org.apache.kafka.connect.source.SourceConnector` .

To build the connector into a zip archive (for use with confluent hub), use `lein package` in the command line.
The generated zip archive will be within *targets*, named **juxt-crux-kafka-connect-<VERSION>.zip.**
